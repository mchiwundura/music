# 🎶 Mangoma

Welcome to **Mangoma** — my personal collection of code-based music made with [Strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)!
Each piece here lives in the `songs/` folder and is named after the vibe (or chaos) it brings 😎

## 🎵 How to Jam

It’s super simple to try these out:

1. Open [Strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)
2. Copy the code from any file in the `songs/` folder
3. Paste it into the editor
4. Hit **Play** ▶️
5. Enjoy the noise 🎧

You can tweak, remix, or mash up stuff however you like — Strudel is all about **play**.

## 🗂️ Repo Layout

```
songs/
 ├─ smells_like_teen_spirit.js
 ├─ meltdown.js
 ├─ song2.js
 └─ ...
```

Each file is a **self-contained jam** — no setup, no dependencies, just copy and play.
